# üéØ Critical Coordinate Bug Fix - Location-Accurate Webhook System

## Problem Identified

**CRITICAL BUG**: The webhook system was using incorrect geographic coordinates, causing customers to receive wrong store recommendations.

### Before Fix:
- ZIP 33818 customers were being searched at coordinates `52.0081232, 8.7010651` (Osnabr√ºck, Germany)
- This resulted in either no stores found or completely irrelevant international locations
- Make automation received inaccurate location data for store coordination
- Core promise "Sleep on it tonight" was compromised due to wrong store assignments

### Root Cause:
The webhook system was re-geocoding ZIP codes through Google's geocoding API instead of using the customer's stored coordinates, leading to geographic mismatches.

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes in `server/routes.ts`:

**BEFORE** (Lines 1127-1180):
```typescript
// Get real stores for customer's ZIP code
const realStoreSearch = await googleMaps.searchMattressFirmStores(customerZipCode);
// This was re-geocoding the ZIP and getting wrong coordinates
```

**AFTER** (Lines 1134-1178):
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Use customer's stored coordinates directly instead of re-geocoding
const customerCoordinates = profileForWebhook.coordinates;

if (customerCoordinates && customerCoordinates.lat && customerCoordinates.lng) {
  console.log(`üéØ Using customer's stored coordinates: ${customerCoordinates.lat}, ${customerCoordinates.lng}`);
  
  // Get real stores using customer's exact coordinates
  const realStoreSearch = await googleMaps.findNearbyMattressFirmStores(
    customerCoordinates.lat, 
    customerCoordinates.lng
  );
  // ... warehouse search using same exact coordinates
```

### Technical Implementation:

1. **Primary Path**: Use customer's stored coordinates directly from profile
2. **Fallback Path**: Only use geocoding if no stored coordinates available
3. **Coordinate Validation**: Verify lat/lng exist before using
4. **Consistent Data**: Both stores and warehouses use same coordinate source

## Testing Results

### ZIP 33818 Verification:
**Customer Coordinates**: `27.9506, -82.4572` (Correct Florida location)

**Stores Found**: ‚úÖ 5 authentic Mattress Firm stores in Florida
**Warehouses Found**: ‚úÖ 2 authentic Mattress Firm warehouses:
- **Riverview Warehouse**: 6524 Pelican Creek Cir, Riverview (7.4 miles)
- **Orlando Warehouse**: 3670 8th St Suite 400, Orlando (75.4 miles)

**Webhook Status**: ‚úÖ 200 "Accepted" by Make automation
**Reference Codes**: ‚úÖ MP-1000, MP-1001 successfully generated

## System Verification
