You are a Replit AI coding assistant building a premium mattress locator funnel for a high-ticket sales expert.

Your job is to take the following structured flow and build a full interactive multi-step UI in React (or similar frontend tech), styled clean and modern (tailwind or basic CSS is fine), that walks a user from intent → location match → mattress preference → lead capture.

---

✅ GOAL:
Design a simple, elegant UI that feels like a concierge-level digital assistant helping users find a mattress for pickup nearby. Everything must feel premium, simple, and frictionless.

No emojis. Use clean info cards, subtle visual cues, sleek layouts.

---

🧠 FUNCTIONALITY SUMMARY:
- Use the Google Maps API (or Places API if more precise)
- Accept ZIP code or current location
- Filter only stores where the name starts with “Mattress Firm”
- Show matches with name, phone, distance
- Let user select their intent and preferences
- Capture their contact info and send a summary to the backend
- Provide option to auto-generate a pre-filled SMS

---

💡 UI FLOW & LOGIC:

STEP 1: Location Detection
- Ask user to enter ZIP code or allow location
- Use geolocation API to detect position
- Trigger search for Mattress Firm stores only
- If no permission or address not found, show a clear error message

Display:
- Message: “Great news – we found a few stores near you.”
- Animated loading dial or simple visual to indicate progress
- Show 3–5 closest Mattress Firm locations (name, number, distance)
- Filter out anything that doesn’t include “Mattress Firm” in the name
- Example format:
    - Mattress Firm Zinfandel – (916) 852-1045 – 0.7 mi

---

STEP 2: Use Case Identification
Prompt:
“Who is this mattress for?”

Options (as selectable cards):
- Me
- My Child
- Guest Room
- Dorm Room
- Airbnb
- Other

Tag this value in backend logic.

---

STEP 3: Mattress Size Selection
Prompt:
“What size mattress do you need?”

Options:
- Twin
- Full
- Queen
- King

Each size card should:
- Include a visual size chart comparison (basic graphic or illustration)
- Show rough dimensions (inches)
- Tooltip: Twin = kids or small adults. Queen = most common adult size. King = luxury/master bedroom, etc.

---

STEP 4: Comfort Preference
Prompt:
“How do you like your mattress to feel?”

Options:
- Firm
- Medium (most popular)
- Plush
- Hybrid

Include short educational blurbs under each:
- Firm: Dense, supportive feel with minimal sink.
- Medium: Balanced support and comfort – best seller.
- Plush: Soft, fluffy feel for pressure relief.
- Hybrid: Coil + foam combo for bounce and support.

---

STEP 5: Confirmation + Lead Capture

Message:
“Perfect. We’ll now check which of these locations has your exact mattress style in stock – all under $800 with pickup as soon as tonight.”

Display two options:

Option 1 – Speed it up:
- Button: “Text me the best match now”
- Auto-generate SMS preview:
    - “Hey – here’s what I’m looking for: Queen, Plush, for master bedroom, ZIP 95670. Can you help me find the best pickup nearby under $800?”
- Provide “Copy & Text” button that copies the message and opens native SMS app.

Option 2 – Sit tight:
- Message: “We’ll search for the perfect match and text you within 15 minutes.”
- Form:
    - Name (required)
    - Phone (required)
    - Email (optional)
    - Notes (optional)

---

📦 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Store all user inputs as a single object:
    {
      use_case: "Guest Room",
      size: "Full",
      feel: "Medium",
      zip: "95670",
      nearest_locations: [...],
      contact_info: {...},
    }

- Flag stores that match query and proximity

- Add field for lead_source (web, mobile, ad campaign tag if applicable)

---

🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVE:
Make this entire process frictionless, human, intuitive — like talking to a concierge. User should feel guided, understood, and taken care of every step of the way.

No corporate or salesy vibe. All language should feel like an expert guiding them through a simple solution to a very solvable problem.

Deliver a working prototype with placeholder data and dummy SMS/email handler endpoints.
