## **üì± KEY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED**

### **1. Remove Store Selection Friction**
- Don't make users pick a store
- Auto-select closest store with inventory
- Show store info after mattress selection

### **2. Enhanced Mattress Cards**
```
Each card needs:
- Mattress name (large, bold)
- Sleep position guidance
- Star rating (builds trust)
- Price range (transparency)
- Key benefits (warranty, try first, fits in car)
- Clear selection button
```

### **3. Better Trust Signals**
```
Add to each mattress:
- "4.8/5 stars from 2,847 reviews"
- "Best seller" badge on popular options
- "Brand new with full warranty"
- "Same mattress others wait weeks for"
```

### **4. Urgency Without Pressure**
```
Replace generic urgency with real benefits:
- "Ready for pickup right now"
- "Sleep on it tonight"
- "No 2-week delivery wait"
- "Try it first, then decide"
```

## **üé® DESIGN REFINEMENTS**

### **Mattress Card Layout:**
```
[Image/Icon - clean, professional]
[MATTRESS NAME] - Large, bold
[Sleep position text] - Medium gray
[Rating stars + review count] - Trust signal
[Price] - Clear, prominent
[Benefits checklist] - 3-4 key points
[SELECT BUTTON] - Large, clear CTA
```

### **Color Psychology:**
```
- Trust: Keep the blue gradient
- Success: Green for "available" and "open"
- Urgency: Subtle orange/red for "closes soon"
- Premium: Clean whites and grays
```

### **Mobile Optimization:**
```
- Cards stack vertically
- Large touch targets (60px+)
- Easy thumb scrolling
- Clear typography (16px+ on mobile)
- Fast loading and smooth animations
```

Current: "Need a Mattress Tonight?"
Better: "Need a Mattress Tonight? We've Got You Covered."

Current: "Premium mattresses available for pickup in 30 minutes"
Better: "Top-rated mattresses ready for pickup in 30 minutes"
```

### **Mattress Descriptions:**
```
Instead of: "All 4 mattress options available"
Use: "These 4 top-rated mattresses are ready for pickup"

Add sleep guidance:
- "Perfect for back & stomach sleepers"
- "Our most popular choice - works for everyone" 
- "Ideal for side sleepers"
- "Best of both worlds - coil support + foam comfort"
```

### **Trust Building:**
```
Add throughout:
- "Same mattresses others wait 2+ weeks for"
- "Brand new with full manufacturer warranty"
- "Try it in our showroom before you decide"
- "Guaranteed to fit in your car"
```
