Hey, the address entry is looking better and ZIP code lookups are working perfectly — thanks for that. But here’s what still needs fixing before launch:

---

✅ **WHAT’S WORKING:**
- ZIP code input triggers the correct API response and returns nearby Mattress Firm stores.
- Address input UI is cleaner and clearer now (nice).
- The backend seems properly wired for ZIP-based lookups.

---

🚫 **WHAT’S STILL BROKEN:**

1. **Current Location (GPS) Button Still Fails Silently**
   - When clicked, it just spins — but **does not trigger the browser’s location permission request.**
   - No prompt appears to allow location access.
   - Likely culprit: `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(...)` is either:
     - Not being called correctly
     - Being blocked by dev environment security settings
     - Or failing silently without a visible error

   ✅ **Expected fix:**
   - Ensure button calls `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(...)` on click
   - Add visible loading spinner + fail timeout
   - Show user-friendly error if location permission is denied
   - Log any permission denial or geolocation errors in the console

---

2. **Full Address Entry Triggers “Address Not Found” Error**
   - Entering: `18932 Addison lake dr land o lakes fl` throws:
     ```
     Address not found
     Please check the address and try again, or use ZIP code
     ```
   - This is a valid Florida address — should work.
   - Suggesting ZIP code is fine as a fallback, but full address **should work reliably** if we're using Google’s **Geocoding API.**

   ✅ **Expected fix:**
   - Ensure full address input is being passed to Google’s Geocoding API
   - Validate that API response is being properly parsed and converted to lat/lng
   - Add tolerance for slight typos or casing (e.g. “Dr” vs “Drive”)
   - Fallback logic only if Geocoding fails entirely — not prematurely

---

📦 BONUS IMPROVEMENT (Optional but Ideal):
- Autofill city/state/ZIP once address is successfully entered
- Show pin on map preview (for visual reassurance before hitting “Find My Options”)

Let me know once this is pushed — I’ll test again in mobile and verify the permission + address bugs are resolved.
