## Live Message Builder - Progress Feedback & Next Steps

### What’s Working PERFECTLY 🔥

- **Progressive reveal flow** - Fields disappearing after completion is EXACTLY the magic I wanted
- **Step sequence** - Name → Urgency options → Send button flow is spot-on
- **Real-time updates** - The name appearing in the message as I type is the right direction
- **Clean finish** - “Perfect! Your message is ready” with immediate send button is beautiful

### Critical Issues to Fix

**1. Keyboard Visibility Problem**

- Biggest UX issue: Can’t see the message building because keyboard blocks the view
- Need better positioning so message preview stays visible while typing
- Consider moving message preview to top or making it sticky/floating

**2. Timing & Animation Issues**

- Name input transitions too fast - needs slight delay before moving to next step
- Should accommodate longer names and thinking time
- Maybe require explicit “Next” action or wait for pause in typing

**3. Edit Message Functionality**

- “Edit message” button currently glitches and doesn’t work
- Must allow users to go back and modify their inputs
- Should smoothly return to previous steps without breaking

### Technical Refinements Needed

- **Visual feedback** - Make the updating text more prominent/highlighted so they can actually see it change
- **Responsive positioning** - Ensure message preview is always visible despite keyboard
- **Smooth transitions** - Perfect the timing between steps
- **Error handling** - Fix the edit functionality completely

### The Vision is THERE

This is 90% of what I envisioned - the progressive flow and real-time building is exactly the magical experience I want. Just need to solve the visibility and functionality issues to make it production-ready.

**Keep pushing this direction** - you’re nailing the core experience. Focus on keyboard/visibility optimization and fixing the edit function, and this becomes the signature conversion tool that sets us apart.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
