Subject: Comprehensive audit of Step 1 - Customer Location Entry & Store Discovery implementation

Request Overview
I need you to provide a detailed breakdown of how you have implemented Step 1 of our mattress pickup system - specifically the customer location entry and Google Places API integration for Mattress Firm store discovery.
What I Need You To Document
1. Current Implementation Status

Is Step 1 fully implemented and functional?
What components are built vs still in development?
Any known issues or limitations?

2. Customer Input Handling

How does the app capture customer location input?
What input formats are supported (ZIP code, GPS, manual entry)?
How is the {user_input} variable captured and processed?

3. Google Places API Integration Details

Store Search: How is the "Mattress Firm near {user_input}" search implemented?
Warehouse Search: How is the "Mattress Firm Warehouse near {user_input}" search implemented?
What is the current search radius for each type of search?
How many results are you retrieving maximum?

4. Data Filtering & Validation

How are you filtering results to ensure ONLY "Mattress Firm" locations are returned?
What logic excludes competitors (Sleep Number, Tempur-Pedic, etc.)?
How do you validate that results follow the "Mattress Firm [Store Name]" pattern?

5. Data Structure & Organization

What data fields are you capturing for each store location?
How are you extracting the store location name (the part after "Mattress Firm")?
Are stores being sorted by distance (nearest to furthest)?
How is warehouse data being structured differently from store data?

6. Complete Data Output
Please show me the exact JSON structure your Step 1 currently outputs, including:

Sample customer input processing
Example store results array (with real field names and structure)
Warehouse data structure
Any metadata or additional fields being captured

7. Error Handling

What happens if no Mattress Firm stores are found?
What happens if no warehouse is found?
How do you handle API failures or rate limits?
What fallback mechanisms are in place?

8. API Configuration

What are your current Google Places API settings?
How is cost management being handled?
Is the API currently connected or disconnected?

Response Format Requested
Please structure your response as follows:
## STEP 1 IMPLEMENTATION AUDIT

### Status Overview
[Current implementation status]

Goal
I want to understand exactly what you've built so I can:

Verify it matches our Step 1 specification requirements
Identify any gaps or issues that need addressing
Confirm the data structure works for downstream processing
Validate that the business logic is correctly implemented

Please be thorough and specific - I need complete visibility into the current Step 1 implementation.
