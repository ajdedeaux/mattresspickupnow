Perfect! Now you understand the complete user journey and where the gap is. Let me break down exactly what you need to tell your AI dev agent.

## The Missing Piece: User Tracking & Reference Code Generation

### Current Problem:
- Users go through app → select preferences → reach contact page
- But there's NO unique reference code generated 
- No data package created for your automation to lookup
- Manual entry required (which kills the business model)

### What Needs to Be Built:

## User Journey Data Flow:
```
App Entry → Generate UUID immediately → Track all selections → 
Complete Profile → Generate Reference Code → Display to User → 
Store in Database → Ready for Automation
```

## Instructions for Your AI Dev Agent:

**"I need you to build a user tracking and reference code system for my mattress app. Here's exactly what needs to happen:

### 1. Data Capture Throughout App Flow
- **Page 1 (ZIP entry):** Generate unique tracking ID, store ZIP code
- **Page 2 (Demographics):** Add who it's for to user profile  
- **Page 3 (Size selection):** Add size preference to profile
- **Page 4 (Firmness/Model):** Add firmness + calculate final price
- **Final Page:** Generate reference code + complete data package

### 2. Reference Code Generation
- **When:** After firmness selection (when profile is complete)
- **Format:** MP-XXXX (e.g., MP-1234, MP-5678)  
- **Display:** Show prominently before contact options
- **Purpose:** Customer uses this when they contact us

### 3. Data Package Creation
Create complete customer record with:
```json
{
  "reference_code": "MP-1234",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T15:30:00Z",
  "name": "[collected in contact flow]",
  "zip_code": "33647", 
  "demographics": "personal",
  "size": "Queen",
  "firmness": "Medium", 
  "model": "Sealy Memory Foam Medium",
  "price": "$399.99",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### 4. Integration Points Needed
- **Webhook endpoint** to send data to n8n automation
- **Google Sheets integration** to store customer records  
- **Reference code display** on contact page
- **Contact flow modification** to include reference code

### 5. Contact Flow Updates

**Text Option:**
- Show reference code prominently  
- Pre-populate message: "Hi! My reference code is MP-1234. I'm interested in the Queen Medium mattress for $399. I'm in the Tampa area and need help finding pickup locations today."

**Call Option:**  
- Display reference code prominently
- Instructions: "When you call, provide this reference code: MP-1234"
- Still show phone number for dialing

**Email Option:**
- Pre-populate subject: "Mattress Pickup Request - Reference MP-1234"
- Pre-populate body with all details

### 6. Backend Requirements
- Database to store customer profiles
- API endpoint to receive data from app
- Integration with Google Sheets for automation
- Reference code generation algorithm

### 7. Price Lock Feature
- Display selected mattress and locked price
- "Your price: $399 - locked for 24 hours with code MP-1234"
- Creates urgency and professional appearance"

## This Solves Your Automation Gap

Once built, your n8n automation will:
1. Receive customer contact with reference code
2. Look up complete profile automatically  
3. Send instant response with personalized info
4. No manual data entry required

**The key insight:** You need the app to CREATE the customer records that your automation READS. Right now you're manually creating what the app should be generating automatically.
