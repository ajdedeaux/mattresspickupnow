# 🚀 MattressPickupNow - Complete Developer Specification

## **📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **Business Model**

Create an ultra-simple lead capture system that connects emergency mattress buyers directly to Mattress Firm stores through an automated Podium messaging system. The entire process takes 5 minutes from lead submission to customer action.

### **Target User Experience**

A person needs a mattress urgently (moving, broken mattress, guests coming). They find the website, submit 5 pieces of information, and immediately get a pre-written text message they can copy and send to get instant quotes and pickup locations.

### **Revenue Model**

Owner gets $17-36 commission per mattress sale. Target: 20+ leads/day converting at 65%+ rate = $300-700 daily revenue.
