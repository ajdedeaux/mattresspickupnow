## Smart Dynamic Message Builder - Complete Brief

### The Vision: Fully Personalized Pre-Populated Experience

Transform the generic template into a personalized commitment statement using ALL their funnel data, with visual indicators showing what’s already captured vs. what they need to provide.

### Dynamic Data Population Requirements:

**Mattress Selection Integration:**

- Pull their exact mattress choice: “Queen Medium Hybrid for $499”
- Include specific product name if selected: “Sealy Memory Foam Queen Medium for $399”
- Show the actual price they saw during selection

**Smart Location Logic:**

- ZIP code only → “in the 33606 area”
- Precise location/city → “in downtown Tampa” or “in Westchase”
- Current location used → “near my current location”
- Use neighborhood/city names when API provides them

### Visual Distinction Strategy:

**Pre-Populated Data (Different Styling):**

- Mattress selection, size, price → **Bold or highlighted background**
- Location information → **Bold or highlighted background**
- Static message parts → **Different color/styling to show “we got this”**

**User Input Fields (Current Styling):**

- Name → **Placeholder styling until filled**
- Urgency → **Placeholder styling until selected**

### Example Visual Treatment:

```
"Hi! My name is [NAME INPUT] and I'm in **the Westchase area**. 
I just used your mattress finder and I'm interested in **the Queen 
Medium Hybrid for $499** that I selected. I'd like to come try it 
[URGENCY INPUT] and buy it if it's right for me. Can you help me 
find the best pickup location? Please get back to me right away, 
I'm ready to move forward!"
```

### Psychology Behind Visual Treatment:

- **Bold/highlighted sections** = “We captured this perfectly”
- **Regular input sections** = “Just need these 2 things from you”
- **Clear visual separation** = “Look how much we already know vs. how little you need to add”

### User Experience Flow:

1. **See pre-populated data** → “Wow, they got everything right”
1. **See minimal input needed** → “Just my name and timing? Easy!”
1. **Fill in gaps** → Watch their personal message complete
1. **Send** → Feel ownership of THEIR specific choice

### Technical Requirements:

- Pull all selection data from previous funnel steps
- Apply location intelligence based on input method
- Style pre-populated content differently (bold, background color, or highlight)
- Keep user input fields in current styling until completed
- Ensure real-time updates maintain visual distinction

### The Result:

A message that feels like a **personalized purchase confirmation** rather than a generic inquiry. Users see their exact selections reflected back, creating ownership and commitment before they even send the message.

**This transforms casual interest into confirmed purchase intent!** 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
