Hey, here’s what’s broken and needs to be fixed immediately on the location input system:

---

📍 **1. “Use My Location (GPS)” Button Not Working**

- ❌ When tapped, the button just spins.
- 🚫 It doesn’t trigger the browser’s geolocation permission prompt.
- ✅ Expected behavior:
  - Should call `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(...)`
  - Should request permission and retrieve coordinates
  - Should send coordinates to the backend to fetch nearby Mattress Firm stores
- 🛠️ Fix:
  - Add proper event listener to the button
  - Handle permission success + error gracefully
  - Pass `lat/lng` to backend (via `/api/nearby-stores` or similar)
  - Console log any permission or API failures

---

🏠 **2. “Full Address” Field is Buggy and Confusing**

- ❌ Placeholder says “Enter your complete address” — but doesn’t clarify what it’s used for
- ❌ When tapped, placeholder text overlaps with the user’s input
- ❌ Input only allows **numbers** — it should accept **full addresses** (letters, commas, etc.)
- ✅ Expected behavior:
  - Input accepts any valid address format (e.g., `123 Main St, Tampa, FL`)
  - Placeholder should disappear on focus
  - Add helpful copy below the input:  
    _“Enter the address near where you’d like to pick up your mattress (e.g., your home or work).”_

📫 **3. ZIP Code Input Works, But Needs Improvements**

- ✅ This is the only functional option right now
- 🧠 Please reuse this logic for both the full address and GPS flow:
  - For full address, use the **Geocoding API** to get lat/lng
  - For GPS, use `navigator.geolocation` directly
  - Send `lat/lng` to backend → use **Google Places API** to fetch nearby Mattress Firm stores

---

🧪 **4. Final Test Case:**

- Enter ZIP: `33607`
- Expected response:
  - Real Mattress Firm stores near Tampa
  - Includes: store name, address, phone number, hours, distance
- ✅ Should be displayed in dropdown or results list

Please fix all 3 inputs, wire them to real backend API calls (no simulation), and verify frontend behavior with console logs.

Let me know once it's live so I can test.
