## **🎯 RESPONSE TEMPLATES (For Manual Replies)**

### **Customer Asks About Car Fit:**

```
Great question! Your {{SIZE}} {{MATTRESS_TYPE}} comes compressed in a box that's about the size of a large suitcase. It easily fits on the back seat of any car - even small cars like Honda Civics! 🚗

Once you get it home, cut the plastic and it expands to full size in a few hours. Magic! ✨
```

### **Customer Wants to Reschedule:**

```
No problem, {{NAME}}! We can hold your {{SIZE}} {{MATTRESS_TYPE}} and your {{PRICE}} price for up to 48 more hours.

When works better for you?
• Today after 5pm?
• Tomorrow morning?
• This weekend?

Just let me know and I'll update {{STORE_NAME}} 👍
```

### **Customer Has Budget Concerns:**

```
I totally understand, {{NAME}}! Here's the thing - this {{SIZE}} {{MATTRESS_TYPE}} normally costs {{ORIGINAL_PRICE}}, but you're getting it for {{PRICE}}.

That's a savings of ${{SAVINGS}}! These prices are from our special pickup program and won't last.

Plus, you can test it in the store first - no risk! 🛏️

  const lead = getLead(leadId);
  
  if (!lead.pickedUp) {
    const message = generateFollowUpMessage(lead, stage);
    sendSMS(lead.phone, message);
    
    // Schedule next follow-up
    if (stage < 4) {
      scheduleFollowUp(leadId, getNextStage(stage));
