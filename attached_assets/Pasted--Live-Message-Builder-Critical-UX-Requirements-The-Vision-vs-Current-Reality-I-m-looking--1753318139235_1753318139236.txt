## Live Message Builder - Critical UX Requirements

### The Vision vs. Current Reality

I’m looking for a **truly magical, real-time experience** where users watch their personalized message build letter-by-letter as they type. The current implementations are close but still feel like forms, not like interactive magic.

### What I Need: Progressive Reveal Flow

**Step-by-step progression where each completed field disappears and the next appears:**

1. **Name field appears** → User types → Message updates live with each keystroke → Field completes → **Field disappears, urgency options appear**
1. **Urgency selection** → User selects → Message updates → Selection completes → **Urgency disappears, send button appears**
1. **Send button ready** → One tap → Done

### Key Requirements:

- **Real-time character updates** - Every letter they type appears instantly in the message preview
- **Progressive interface** - Completed sections disappear, keeping focus on current step
- **Always visible message** - The building text stays prominent throughout the entire flow
- **Immediate gratification** - As soon as they finish, the send button is right there ready to go

### The Emotional Goal:

When someone experiences this, they should think: **“Holy shit, this is smooth as hell - it’s building my text in real-time and now it’s ready to send. This is exactly what I want to say.”**

### Current Problems:

- Fields stay visible creating visual clutter
- Doesn’t feel magical or gamified enough
- Too much competing for attention
- Not tight/condensed enough

### What Success Looks Like:

A seamless, almost app-like experience where they’re not filling out a form - they’re **building something custom** that feels personal and immediate. The interface should guide them through effortlessly while creating that “wow, this is so smooth” feeling.

**I REALLY want this to work** - this is the key conversion point that separates us from everyone else. If we nail this experience, it becomes our signature move that people remember and talk about.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
