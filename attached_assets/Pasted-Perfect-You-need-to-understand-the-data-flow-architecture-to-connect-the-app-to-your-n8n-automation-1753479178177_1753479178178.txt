Perfect! You need to understand the data flow architecture to connect the app to your n8n automation. Here's the prompt to send to your AI coding agent:

**"I need to understand exactly how and where customer data is being stored as users progress through the app. Please provide a complete technical breakdown of the data storage and tracking system you've built:
Data Storage Analysis Needed:
1. Where is data being stored?

Is it using localStorage, sessionStorage, React state, or a database?
Show me the exact storage mechanism and location
How persistent is this data? (page refresh, browser close, etc.)

2. Data Flow Documentation:

Show me the exact customer profile object structure being created
When and where does each piece of data get added to the profile?
Trace the data flow from ZIP entry → demographics → size → firmness → reference code generation

3. Reference Code System:

Where exactly is the reference code stored after generation?
How is it tied to the customer profile data?
Can I access this data externally via API or export?

4. Integration Points:

Do you have any webhooks or API endpoints set up to send data externally?
Can you show me how to connect this to Google Sheets automatically?
What would I need to integrate this with n8n automation?

5. Current Data Access:

How can I view/export the customer profiles that are being created?
Is there an admin panel or way to see all customer data?
Can you show me exactly what data is available when someone completes the flow?

6. Missing Connections:

What needs to be built to automatically send customer data to my Google Sheets?
How can I set up real-time data transfer to my n8n automation system?
What API endpoints or webhooks do I need?

Please provide:

Code snippets showing the data storage implementation
Sample customer profile object with real data
Step-by-step data flow from app start to completion
Integration recommendations for connecting to external systems
Any database tables/schemas if using a database

This information is critical for connecting the app to my automated lead processing system."
